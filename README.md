# Project Overview
2-COM has a new client, Couch & Recline, who specializes in furniture sales. They have been in the furniture business for over 30 years. However, in the past 5 years, CEO Dustin Roiland has noticed a sharp decline in furniture sales. Couch & Recline's marketing research concluded that this is the result of their weak web presence. Dustin Roiland has asked 2-COM to design and develop a marketing site.

You are to develop a single page of a marketing site for Couch & Recline that lists some of their most popular furniture offerings. Feel free to use the internet for reference. If you don't get it done, it's okay!

### Description
We’ll test your abilities by having you develop a single page of a fictional marketing site.  The page will list various types of furniture, displaying product images, names, and descriptions. There is a form in the footer which allows users to signup for a newsletter. Take your time and code as much as you can utilizing the designs provided.
